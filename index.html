<div id= "intro"><p> I will carry your flowers is an ongoing performance in which you are invited to send me flowers to commemorate a moment of impact, trauma or loss. I will carry your flowers for two weeks in a backpack modified as a planter while meditating on your experience through journals, drawings and audio. Following the performance you will receive a box of its artifacts including video documentation of your flowers journey and the stalks themselves. These remnants will also be collected and displayed in an online archive. a box of its artifacts including video documentation of your flowers journey and the stalks themselves.
